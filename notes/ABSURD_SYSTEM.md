# Booleanism Notes: Absurd System

## Key Takeaways

### Absurd Imply is just AND (means we can ignore IMPLY in the Absurd System)

I try to think that what if the premise is false, make all the whole proposition false.
But if the premise is true, it's still the same with how normal imply does. (I call it the "**Absurd System**")

Normal Imply (->):

- True -> True === True
- True -> False === False
- False -> True === True (The premise false make the whole sentence true.)
- False -> False === False (The premise false make the whole sentence true.)

Absurd Imply (~>):

- True ~> True === True
- True ~> False === False
- False ~> True === False (The premise false make the whole sentence false.)
- False ~> False === False (The premise false make the whole sentence false.)

Did you notice that? It's just like how AND operator does, because if some operand is false will make the whole proposition is false too.

Conclusion: In the Absurd System, we can ignore IMPLY (in sense of ABSURD_IMPLY in this system) and use only AND to describe the IF...THEN situation.
